### Student Info

## Game Design

-   Camera Orientation: Side View
-   Camera Movement: Mixed
    1. Tracking when progressing towards the level end
    2. Fixed when facing the boss
-   Player Health: Healthbar

-   Scoring: Hitting / defeating enemies, collecting items.

[!]The player must have a set interaction with the edges of the screen.
It is up to you what the interaction is but must be documented in your README file.
Warp, Stop, and Camera Follow(??) are just a few of the options you could choose.

[!]There must be a delay between bullets fired so that each bullet is clearly distinguishable from the others.
Your solution must be documented in the README file.

### Game Description

*The game has some inspiration from Neon Genesis Evangelion.*

The 19th Angel, Future has come and is dealing threat. Unlike all angels before, it can spawn numerous minions to spread horror. The more fear it collects, the more powerful Future and all its family become. Your mecha can switch between two specialized modes: air and ground to handle different types of enemies. However, the air mode is more powerful and thus requires energy cores to maintain. That means you must fight with Future in the air once you reach it.

Be brave, my soldier! The whole life of mankind relies on you.

## You Additions

_List out what you added to your game to make it different for you_
- Two combat modes: air and ground. 
  1. The player can shoot at a free angle on the ground while it becomes classic side view Shmup in the air.
  2. The player need to collect energy cores to switch to the air mode. There are also obstacles on the ground.
  3. Score is doubled in the air mode. The player's damage is also buffed. However it has limited time.
- Enemies are not required to be killed but letting them get away will increase the difficulty.
